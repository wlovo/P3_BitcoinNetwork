# CS 327: Project 3

### Instructions
The python program relies on a dataset file found on JMU's servers. The file can be found 
[here](https://crypto.cs.jmu.edu/127.0.1.1_l14340.cs.jmu.edu_2018-03-18-06-45-12-700579-bitcoingraph.graphml),
if access is available.

##### Filepaths
When running the program, make sure to change the file paths in the `bitcoin_data_path` and `geo_ip` to the
correct file locations.

>Example: '~/project_folder/GeoIP.dat'
